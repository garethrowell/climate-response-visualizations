# climate-response-visualizations
This is a placeholder for R data visualizations on climate exposure and ecological system response. The motivation for this work is based on the knowledge that good visualizations help people to understand and remember complex ecological relationships. There is an urgent need for people to understand how ecological systems in National Parks are impacted by climate change. 

# Notes

Probably start with time series plots of water balance data in HTLN parks.
